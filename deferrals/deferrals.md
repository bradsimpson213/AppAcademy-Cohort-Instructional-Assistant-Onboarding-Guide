# Deferral and Academic Dismissal Policy for Online Program

App Academy’s online program is designed to teach software engineering skills rapidly using a mastery based learning approach which takes a minimum of 24 weeks to complete. In order to support this approach, students who fail an assessment will be required to repeat the material by way of deferment, which provides additional opportunities for the student to master the content and pass the subsequent assessment. The deferral process will be handled uniformly. If students are deferred three times and subsequently fail another assessment, the student will be dismissed from App Academy. 


# Deferrals 


## Types of Deferral 

There are three types of deferments: medical, academic, and extenuating circumstances. 


### Medical



* A medical deferment can be processed if the student has provided documentation from a doctor/hospital  
* There is no limit on the number of medical deferrals a student can request. If the student is  continually requesting medical deferrals or if the medical condition takes place during a suspicious time, coordinate with the Senior Manager Instruction. 


### Academic



* An academic deferment is mastery-based; students are allowed a maximum of three academic deferrals. 
    * An academic deferral is processed when a student fails an assessment
        * If a student fails an assessment after three deferrals, the student will be dismissed from the program. 
    * An academic deferral can be processed if a student does not possess needed content knowledge to effectively move forward in their current cohort. 


### Extenuating Circumstances

A student can request a deferral if their circumstances are preventing them from attending their virtual class.  Students who request this type of deferral should be directed to the Senior Manager Instruction.  


## Process for Students Who Receive an Academic Deferment

 Students who fail an assessment will have a 1:1 meeting with the Cohort Lead directly after the assessment scores are revealed. This discussion will be short in length and the following key points will be discussed: 



* Inform the student that, as they may already know, the assessment did not go well for them.  
    * Try to find out why the student is having difficulty
        * Were they studying for the assessment over the weekend? 
        * Did they ask questions throughout the week when they weren’t sure of their understanding? 
        * Are they dependent upon solutions, not the process that will take them to it?
        * What could we have done to better prepare them for this assessment? 
* Inform the student that they are being deferred to another cohort in order to gain mastery of the material they are showing signs of difficulty with. 
    * A deferral is an opportunity - they will receive the advantage of extending their learning in order to gain mastery, which is imperative for future employment. 
    * They will now have a chance to learn in a new environment where the student is exposed to a new instructional approach (lectures, Q&A sessions, etc) which can provide new insight into previously confusing material.
    * Each student is allowed three academic deferrals. 
        * **First deferral:** Inform the student that this is their first deferral, so there is no need to panic. 
            * Students should focus on the opportunity for in-depth understanding. 
        * **Second deferral: **Inform the student that this is their second deferral and they will only be allotted one more deferral before dismissal. 
            * Encourage students to participate in Q&A sessions and to speak up when they do not understand the materials. 
        * **Third deferral**: Inform the student that this is their third, and final, deferral. If they fail one more assessment they will be dismissed from the program. 
            * Inform students that they may need to put more time into studying materials and to utilize the resources that are available to them (Q&A time, learning from their pair partner, utilizing study guides). 
* Inform the student of next steps
    * Inform the student of which cohort they will be deferred to, and when they will report 
        * Students who receive a first-time deferment before week 9 will begin with their new cohort on the next day of instruction.
        * Students who receive a first-time deferment after week 9 will begin with their new cohort on the following Tuesday at 8:00 PST. 
        * Students who receive a second or third-time deferment will begin with their new cohort on the following Tuesday at 8:00 PST. 
    * Inform the student of who their new Cohort Lead will be
        * Provide students with contact information for their new Cohort Lead

## Process for Students Who Are Provided A Deferment Due To Extenuating Circumstances

    * Extenuating circumstances are those in which the student cannot control
        * Serious issues at home

# Process for Incoming Deferments

    * Reach out to the previous Cohort Lead if there isn’t enough information available to gleam insight into the students performance and abilities

# Discussing Deferrals With Your Remaining Cohort

A cohort-wide discussion does not need to take place after every weekly deferral. However, in circumstances where a large number of students are deferred from a cohort in a single week, the cohort as a whole  may experience reduced morale. In these instances, you can address the deferrals by stating the following: 



* Talk about the why
    * App Academy is committed to student success and a deferral is a chance to focus on content that students need a bit more time with
    * Inform students that most graduates have been deferred during their tenure and that they may experience this process as well - it is both common and beneficial  
    * A students chance of getting a great job after graduation has nothing to do with how many weeks they have spent in the program, and everything to do with how they have utilized their time here
* Remind them of communication channels
    * Students can, and are encouraged to, communicate with those who have left the cohort via Slack
* Remind students to take advantage of the resources available to them
    * Encourage students to take advantage of Q&A time, supplemental hand-outs, and office hours


# Academic Dismissals 

Students who are academically deferred three times and subsequently fail another assessment will be dismissed from App Academy. Dismissing a student from App Academy is not to be taken lightly, yet we need to recognize that students who do not succeed in our learning environment often find a different program that matches their needs and finds success. App Academy reimburses everything an academically dismissed student has paid, so they can apply those funds to another learning institution. Students also retain access to the App Academy curriculum so they can study at their own pace should they choose to do so. 

Once assessments are graded and a student who has been deferred three times prior  has received a failing score, the Cohort Lead will do the following: 



* Meet with the student 1:1 to discuss the dismissal
    * The dismissal discussion should be given by the Cohort Lead and Student Resource Coordinator directly after the assessment grading is completed. Cohort Leads should not wait until the end of day to dismiss a student
        * Dismissals are non-negotiable
        * Keep the discussion concise and sincere 
    * While having the dismissal talk, make sure to address the following: 
        *  Their last assessment score fell short, and they are being dismissed from the program
        * Not everyone thrives in this environment, and this is not a reflection of their abilities
        * They will receive a full refund of their deposit/tuition within a few days
            * Ask student to contact you if their refund is not communicated within 1 week
            * Stress that the refund is provided so they can find another learning environment that they can succeed in
                * Make a point to inform them that many students who have been dismissed go on to different learning institutions and become successful developers
            * The curriculum will stay available to them
            * They will be removed from Slack and Google by 6pm that day. Encourage them to get contact information from cohort-mates with whom they wish to stay in touch
            * They can stay until the end of the day, or leave immediately
            * Ask if they have any questions
            * Wish them well 
* Use the evaluations feature on Progress Tracker to note important details regarding the dismissal
* Inform Senior Manager of Instruction that the student has been dismissed
