# Scorecard Grading 

**note this is for the original scorecards, will need to revise when the new self graded score cards move from Mod7 to all projects**

Walkthrough video of how to set up and grade the scorecards - great resource for Cohort Leads but also students (was originally a lecture to students)  [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1DhX2v2Zk4xoEh254DJMIKpWWwuq0_eUN/view?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1DhX2v2Zk4xoEh254DJMIKpWWwuq0_eUN/view?usp=sharing)

**Scorecard Tasks:**


1.  Direct students to the reading in a/A Open on W12D1 titled “Group Project Planning”
    1. This is the only reading on scorecards.
    2. Link to a blank scorecard is located in the reading
    3. Link also here: [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1OjY0g6sH783D9RWg9MiyxjHnAuAIG3n8aaAz56jR9To/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1OjY0g6sH783D9RWg9MiyxjHnAuAIG3n8aaAz56jR9To/edit?usp=sharing)

2. You HAVE to walk students through the process of setting up their scorecards the first time, taking 5-10 minutes of lecture time is worth it compared to following up you will have to doon incorrectly set up score cards.
    
    a. Show students how to “Make a copy” (option in the file menu) of the read only version linked above.  Remind them to NOT copy and paste, the formulas and formatting will not copy over.
    
    b. Show students how to make the scorecard Editable by all who have the link. This is a must have so you can grade.

3. Have an EOD, during the project week, where you discuss scorecards, and what we are looking for when we grade them. You could show the recorded video on review/grading, or do a similar live demo of the grading process

4. Make it very clear what metrics are needed to have a “passing” project. Also discuss that the scorecard is more of a progress report than a final grade. Once completed/graded the scorecard is feedback on their project and suggestions on what they need to work on to make their project complete and ready for their portfolio

5. Remind students that their projects must be hosted to be graded. The should host during the project week and then push changes to Heroku daily so the most up to date version of their project is always hosted.

6. It is the Cohort Instructional’s Assistant’s responsibility to have the first 3 projects graded for students, Module 7 will grade their solo Full Stack (aka Capstone)

    a. Try to have the first 2 projects graded before the 3rd project starts. These 2 must be graded before the students enter Module 7 / Career Quest

    b. The 3rd project is presented the day Module 7 / Career Quests starts, so you need to have these graded by the end of the first week into Module 7 (end of week 21)

7. Try to grade the students' projects ASAP. The 2 group projects are very manageable to grade, and ideally you should have those done about a week after presentations

    a. The solo React Project is the most difficult to grade, as there are so many more of them. Get help from the module 5 staff and PTM’s if needed
8. Scorecards are the most significant direct feedback we provide the students with during the course, so make sure to spend adequate time grading each project (30-45min)
